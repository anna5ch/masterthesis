v4.5 - Somehow Isoform Returned

Takes R2C2/C3POa and/or PacBio/ccs/lima data and defines high confidence isoform consensus sequences and alignments.
You can mix and match R2C2/PacBio reads and fasta/fastq files (quality scores are ignored).
Mandalorion is not tested for use with regular ONT reads. I recommend using FLAIR instead for those.

## Short Example 

```bash
to trim polyA tails and or adapter sequences:
Look at the reads in your hypothetical input.5to3.fasta file. 
If your reads look like this (some untrimmed adapter sequences, polyA tail still present)

CATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTAGTACTTGGTGGGG [RNA transcript 1]  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGTGAACTGAGCGACTCTGCGT
CATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTAGTACTTGGTGGGG [RNA transcript 2]  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGTGAACTGAGCGACTCTGCGT
CATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTAGTACTTGGTGGGG [RNA transcript 3]  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGTGAACTGAGCGACTCTGCGT

|-------------33nt--------------|                                           |--------21nt-------|

remove untrimmed adapter sequences and polyA tails like this:

python3 Mandalorion/utils/removePolyA.py -i input.5to3.fasta -o input.5to3.noPolyA.fasta -t 33,21

after trimming adapters and polyA sequences:

python3 Mandalorion/Mando.py -p ./ -g gencodeV29.gtf -G hg38.fasta -f input.5to3.noPolyA.fasta
```

will generate 

Isoform sequences (.fasta), models (.gtf,.psl), and quantification, as well as isoform feature (TSS, PolyA, splice junction) quantification (.quant,.rpm)

## Overview ##

Mandalorion contains several modules that are run sequentially by default (APDFQ) to define, align, and quantify high-quality isoforms.

## Download ##
Just navigate to the folder you want Mandalorion to live and git clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christopher-vollmers/Mandalorion.git
```

## Dependencies ##

Make sure a C++ compiler installed, then run the following to install all dependencies for Mandalorion

```bash
cd Mandalorion
chmod +x setup.sh
sh setup.sh
```

The command installs local copies of

- [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
- [abpoa](https://github.com/yangao07/abPOA)

as well as use pip install to install the correct versions of

- [mappy](https://pypi.org/project/mappy/)

This version was tested with v1.4.1 of abpoa.


## PolyA tail removal ##

It is best to run Mandalorion with reads that have no adapter sequences (trimmed), no polyA tails, and are in 5'->3' orientation. By default, C3POa (v3) does trim reads but doesn't do polyA removal and, depending on the adapters used, may not put reads in 5'->3' orientation..   
Therefore the removePolyA.py script in utils/ should be used to get both PacBio (depending on preprocessing) and R2C2 reads ready.
The script first removes a fixed number of bases (can't be zero) from the ends of the read and then removes the polyA tail on the 3' end of the read. Depending on the polyA position it will also reorient the read in 5'->3' direction.


## Detailed usage ##
You can call Mando.py from the Mandalorion folder or from anywhere else so either

```bash
cd /path/to/Mandalorion/
python3 Mando.py [OPTIONS]
```
or

```bash
python3 /path/to/Mandalorion/Mando.py [OPTIONS]
```

Running with default settings:
```bash
python3 Mando.py -p . -g gencodeV29.gtf -G hg38.fasta -f Consensus_reads.fofn
```

.fofn file structure is simply a text file with one line per input fasta/fastq file.
You can mix and match fasta/fastq files and gzipped and unzipped files.

```bash
/path/to/file1.fasta
/path/to/file2.fastq
/path/to/file4.fastq.gz
```

Here is a full list of options that you can use to modify Mandalorion behavior:

                        file (has to end on .fofn) that contains one file path
                        per line
  -O OVERHANGS, --overhangs OVERHANGS
                        Defines bounds for unaligned bases on ends. Format:
                        min5prime,max5prime,min3prime,max3prime (default
                        0,40,0,40)
  -t MINIMAP2_THREADS, --minimap2_threads MINIMAP2_THREADS
                        Number of threads to use when running minimap and
                        consensus calling (default 4)
  -I MINIMUM_ISOFORM_LENGTH, --minimum_isoform_length MINIMUM_ISOFORM_LENGTH

                        considered (default 200)
  -n MINIMUM_FEATURE_COUNT, --minimum_feature_count MINIMUM_FEATURE_COUNT
                        Features (starts,ends, new splice sites) will be
                        considered if they are present in this number of reads
                        (default 2)
  -w SPLICE_SITE_WINDOW, --splice_site_window SPLICE_SITE_WINDOW
                        reads spliced within this number of nucleotides on
                        each side of a splice site will be considered spliced
                        at this site (default 1)
  -A ACUTOFF, --Acutoff ACUTOFF
                        Isoforms with A content of more than this cutoff in a
                        30nt window surrounding their polyA site will be
                        discarded (default 0.5)
  -W WHITE_LIST_POLYA, --white_list_polyA WHITE_LIST_POLYA
                        If set, polyA sites that fall within +/-20nt of
                        annotated transcript ends will not be filtered
                        regardless of Acutoff set with -A. Annotated
                        transcript ends will be taken from annotation file
                        given with -g. Only transcripts having one of the
                        provided comma separated values in the line of their
                        exon features will be used. E.g. setting -W to
                        [SIRV,"basic"] will whitelist spike-in SIRV
                        transcripts and transcripts considered "basic", i.e.
                        high confidence full length, in the gencode
                        annotation. Setting -W to [exon] should include all
                        transcripts in the gtf file. This is feature only
                        checks whether the provided values are in the line,
                        not where they are. That means that setting -W to
                        [chr1] will whitelist all transcripts on chromosome 1
                        but also transcripts with "chr1" in their name, so
                        it's a bit dangerous
  -m, --multi_exon_only
                        If used, Mandalorion will filter all single exon
                        isoforms
  -j JUNCTIONS, --junctions JUNCTIONS
                        base context required (in lower-case for either
                        strand) to call unannotated splice junctions (default
                        gtag,gcag,atac,ctac,ctgc,gtat)
  -M MODULES, --Modules MODULES
                        Defines what modules of Mandalorion will be run. By
                        default this includes: A - Alignment, P - .sam to
                        .clean.psl conversion, D - defining isoforms, F -
                        Filtering isoforms, Q - Quantifying isoforms. Each
                        module needs the output of the modules run before it
                        to function properly. Running individual modules can
                        be useful if you want to for example filter with
                        different parameters without rerunning the whole
                        pipeline. (default APDFQ)
  -v, --version         Prints Mandalorion version
